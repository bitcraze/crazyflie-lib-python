"""
Example scripts that allows a user to "push" the Crazyflie 2.0 around
using your hands while it's hovering.

This examples uses the Flow and Multi-ranger decks to measure distances
in all directions and tries to keep away from anything that comes closer
than 0.2m by setting a velocity in the opposite direction.

The demo is ended by either pressing Ctrl-C or by holding your hand above the
Crazyflie.

For the example to run the following hardware is needed:
 * Crazyflie 2.0
 * Crazyradio PA
 * Flow deck
 * Multiranger deck
