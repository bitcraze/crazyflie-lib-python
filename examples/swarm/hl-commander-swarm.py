"""
Simple example of a swarm using the High level commander.

The swarm takes off and flies a synchronous square shape before landing.
The trajectories are relative to the starting positions and the Crazyflies can
be at any position on the floor when the script is started.

This example is intended to work with any absolute positioning system.
It aims at documenting how to use the High Level Commander together with
the Swarm class.
